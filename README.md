This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: unhandled exceptions. The code in `bug.js` contains a `divide` function that throws an error if the divisor is zero.  The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to handle this error using try-catch blocks, making the code more robust and preventing unexpected crashes.  This example highlights the importance of proper error handling in JavaScript to create more reliable applications.
